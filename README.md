# Simple blog (AJAX)

I plan on making something similar to this, but with Server-side rendering instead of client side rendering in the near future.

## Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/edazpotato/simple-blog-ajax.git`
2. `cd simple-blog-ajax`
3. `npm install`
4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and change the posting token to something secure.
5. `npm run start`
6. Go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser. Congratulations, you just made a blog!!!
7. You can customize the look of the site by changing files in the `public/` directory
8. Replace the contents of `posts.json` with an empty array to clear out my example posts

```json
{
	"posts": []
}
```
